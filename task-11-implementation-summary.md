- Configures Health Checks UI with monitoring dashboard
- Defines readiness and liveness probes for Kubernetes

### 6. Health Check Controller
**File:** `Sis-Pdv-Controle-Estoque-API/Controllers/HealthCheckController.cs`
- RESTful API endpoints for health monitoring
- Provides system, business, and application metrics
- Dashboard endpoint with combined metrics
- Component-specific health check queries

## Health Check Endpoints

### Public Endpoints (No Authentication)
- `GET /health` - Detailed health status of all components
- `GET /health/ready` - Readiness probe (for Kubernetes)
- `GET /health/live` - Liveness probe (for Kubernetes)
- `GET /health/simple` - Simple health check
- `GET /health-ui` - Health monitoring dashboard UI

### Protected Endpoints (Require Authentication)
- `GET /api/v1.0/healthcheck/status` - Comprehensive health status
- `GET /api/v1.0/healthcheck/metrics/system` - System performance metrics
- `GET /api/v1.0/healthcheck/metrics/business` - Business metrics
- `GET /api/v1.0/healthcheck/metrics/application` - Application metrics
- `GET /api/v1.0/healthcheck/dashboard` - Combined dashboard metrics
- `GET /api/v1.0/healthcheck/components` - Available health check components
- `GET /api/v1.0/healthcheck/component/{component}` - Specific component health

## Health Check Components

### Infrastructure Health Checks
1. **Database (MySQL)** - Connection and query performance
2. **RabbitMQ** - Message broker connectivity and status
3. **Memory** - Application memory usage monitoring

### Custom Health Checks
1. **Business Operations** - Product inventory, user activity, order processing
2. **System Metrics** - CPU, memory, disk usage, and process metrics

## Configuration

### appsettings.json Updates
```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Database=PDV_02;Uid=root;Pwd=root;AllowPublicKeyRetrieval=true;SslMode=None;",
    "RabbitMQ": "amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672/"
  },
  "HealthChecks": {
    "EvaluationTimeInSeconds": 30,
    "MaximumHistoryEntriesPerEndpoint": 50,
    "UI": {
      "MaximumExecutionHistoriesPerEndpoint": 100,
      "ApiPath": "/health-ui-api",
      "UIPath": "/health-ui"
    }
  }
}
```

### Service Registration
Updated `Setup.cs` to register health check services:
- `IMetricsCollectionService` and implementation
- Custom health check classes
- Health check configuration

## Monitoring Features

### System Monitoring
- CPU usage percentage
- Memory consumption (used/total)
- Disk space utilization
- Process metrics (threads, handles, uptime)

### Business Monitoring
- Total products and low stock alerts
- Active users and user activity
- Sales metrics (today's sales and revenue)
- Pending orders and order processing

### Application Monitoring
- Request counts (total and failed)
- Average response times
- Requests per second
- Active sessions and uptime

## Testing

### Test Script
**File:** `test-health-monitoring.ps1`
- Comprehensive test script for all health check endpoints
- Tests both public and protected endpoints
- Validates authentication and authorization
- Performance testing with concurrent requests
- Error scenario testing

### Test Coverage
- Basic health check endpoints
- Authentication and authorization
- System, business, and application metrics
- Individual component health checks
- Dashboard functionality
- Error handling and edge cases

## Integration Points

### Kubernetes Support
- Readiness probe: `/health/ready`
- Liveness probe: `/health/live`
- Proper HTTP status codes for probe responses

### Monitoring Tools Integration
- Prometheus-compatible metrics endpoints
- Health Checks UI for visual monitoring
- JSON responses for external monitoring systems

### Alerting Capabilities
- Configurable thresholds for system resources
- Business rule violations (low stock, high pending orders)
- Performance degradation alerts

## Security Considerations

### Authentication
- Public endpoints for basic health checks and probes
- Protected endpoints require JWT authentication
- Role-based access control for sensitive metrics

### Data Protection
- No sensitive data exposed in health check responses
- Sanitized error messages
- Secure configuration management

## Performance Impact

### Minimal Overhead
- Lightweight health checks with configurable intervals
- Efficient metrics collection using background processing
- Cached results to reduce database load
- Asynchronous operations throughout

### Scalability
- Stateless health check implementation
- Distributed caching support ready
- Horizontal scaling compatible

## Maintenance and Operations

### Monitoring Dashboard
- Real-time health status visualization
- Historical health check data
- Component-specific monitoring
- Performance trends and alerts

### Troubleshooting
- Detailed error messages and logging
- Component isolation for issue identification
- Performance metrics for bottleneck detection
- Business metrics for operational insights
