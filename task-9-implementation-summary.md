- Comprehensive validation error reporting

### Restore Functionality
- Database restore with target database selection
- File restore with selective restoration
- Pre-restore backup creation for safety
- Verification before restore operations
- Detailed restore result reporting

### Scheduled Backups
- Configurable backup schedules (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly)
- Separate schedules for different backup types
- Automatic cleanup of expired backups
- Background processing with proper error handling
- Configurable retention policies

### Security and Authorization
- Permission-based access control
- Separate permissions for backup creation and restore operations
- Audit logging for all backup operations
- Secure file handling and path validation

## Configuration Added

### appsettings.json
```json
{
  "Backup": {
    "BackupDirectory": "backups",
    "RetentionDays": 30,
    "CompressBackups": true,
    "VerifyWithTestRestore": false
  },
  "BackupSchedule": {
    "EnableScheduledBackups": true,
    "DatabaseBackupSchedule": {
      "Enabled": true,
      "Frequency": "Daily",
      "Interval": 1,
      "PreferredTime": "02:00:00"
    },
    "FileBackupSchedule": {
      "Enabled": true,
      "Frequency": "Weekly",
      "Interval": 1,
      "PreferredTime": "03:00:00"
    },
    "FullBackupSchedule": {
      "Enabled": true,
      "Frequency": "Monthly",
      "Interval": 1,
      "PreferredTime": "01:00:00"
    },
    "DatabaseRetentionDays": 30,
    "FileRetentionDays": 7,
    "FullBackupRetentionDays": 90
  }
}
```

## API Endpoints

### Backup Operations
- `POST /api/backup/database` - Create database backup
- `POST /api/backup/files` - Create file backup
- `POST /api/backup/full` - Create full backup
- `POST /api/backup/verify` - Verify backup integrity
- `GET /api/backup` - List all backups
- `DELETE /api/backup/{backupId}` - Delete backup

### Restore Operations
- `POST /api/backup/restore/database` - Restore database from backup
- `POST /api/backup/restore/files` - Restore files from backup

## Dependencies and Requirements

### External Dependencies
- mysqldump (for database backups)
- mysql (for database restores)
- System.IO.Compression (for ZIP file operations)
- MySqlConnector (for database operations)

### Permissions Required
- `backup.create` - Create backups
- `backup.restore` - Restore from backups

## Testing

Created comprehensive test script (`test-backup-system.ps1`) that covers:
- Authentication and authorization
- Database backup creation and verification
- File backup creation and verification
- Full backup creation
- Backup listing and metadata
- Database restore testing
- File restore testing
- Error handling and edge cases

## Error Handling

### Comprehensive Error Management
