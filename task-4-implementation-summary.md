# Task 4 Implementation Summary: Improve Entity Models and Database Structure

## ‚úÖ Completed Components

### 1. Enhanced EntityBase with Audit Fields
**Location:** `Sis-Pdv-Controle-Estoque/Model/Base/EntityBase.cs`

The EntityBase class has been enhanced with comprehensive audit fields:
- `CreatedAt` - Timestamp when entity was created
- `UpdatedAt` - Timestamp when entity was last modified  
- `CreatedBy` - User ID who created the entity
- `UpdatedBy` - User ID who last modified the entity
- `IsDeleted` - Soft delete flag
- `DeletedAt` - Timestamp when entity was soft deleted
- `DeletedBy` - User ID who soft deleted the entity

All existing entities inherit from EntityBase and automatically get these audit fields.

### 2. User Management Entities
All user management entities have been created with proper relationships:

#### Usuario (User) Entity
**Location:** `Sis-Pdv-Controle-Estoque/Model/Usuario.cs`
- Enhanced with additional fields: Email, Nome, LastLoginAt, RefreshToken, RefreshTokenExpiryTime
- Configured with proper mapping in `MapUsuario.cs`
- Includes navigation properties to UserRoles

#### Role Entity  
**Location:** `Sis-Pdv-Controle-Estoque/Model/Role.cs`
- Properties: Name, Description, IsActive
- Navigation properties to RolePermissions and UserRoles
- Configured with proper mapping in `MapRole.cs`

#### Permission Entity
**Location:** `Sis-Pdv-Controle-Estoque/Model/Permission.cs`  
- Properties: Name, Description, Resource, Action
- Navigation properties to RolePermissions
- Configured with proper mapping in `MapPermission.cs`

#### UserRole Entity (Junction Table)
**Location:** `Sis-Pdv-Controle-Estoque/Model/UserRole.cs`
- Links Users to Roles (many-to-many relationship)
- Navigation properties to User and Role
- Configured with proper mapping in `MapUserRole.cs`

#### RolePermission Entity (Junction Table)
**Location:** `Sis-Pdv-Controle-Estoque/Model/RolePermission.cs`
- Links Roles to Permissions (many-to-many relationship)  
- Navigation properties to Role and Permission
- Configured with proper mapping in `MapRolePermission.cs`

### 3. AuditLog Entity
**Location:** `Sis-Pdv-Controle-Estoque/Model/AuditLog.cs`

Comprehensive audit logging entity with:
- `EntityName` - Name of the entity being tracked
- `EntityId` - ID of the specific entity instance
- `Action` - Type of action (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- `Changes` - Summary of changes made
- `UserId` - User who performed the action
- `Timestamp` - When the action occurred
- `OldValues` - JSON of previous values
- `NewValues` - JSON of new values
- Navigation property to User

### 4. Audit Interceptor
**Location:** `Sis-Pdv-Controle-Estoque-Infra/Interceptors/AuditInterceptor.cs`

Entity Framework interceptor that automatically:
- Populates audit fields (CreatedAt, UpdatedAt, CreatedBy, UpdatedBy) on save
- Implements soft delete by setting IsDeleted flag instead of actual deletion
- Creates detailed audit log entries for all entity changes
- Serializes old and new values as JSON for complete change tracking
- Handles user context (currently simplified, can be enhanced with proper user context service)

### 5. Repository Implementations
All repository interfaces and implementations have been created:
- `IRepositoryRole` / `RepositoryRole`
- `IRepositoryPermission` / `RepositoryPermission`  
- `IRepositoryUserRole` / `RepositoryUserRole`
- `IRepositoryRolePermission` / `RepositoryRolePermission`
- `IRepositoryAuditLog` / `RepositoryAuditLog`

### 6. Entity Framework Configuration
- All entities are properly configured in `PdvContext.cs`
- Entity mappings include proper indexes for performance
- Foreign key relationships are correctly defined
- Audit interceptor is registered and configured

### 7. Dependency Injection Setup
**Location:** `Sis-Pdv-Controle-Estoque-API/Setup.cs`
- AuditInterceptor is registered in DI container
- All repository interfaces are registered with their implementations

## üîß Database Migration

A migration has been prepared to add all audit fields and new entities. Due to existing data constraints, a manual SQL script has been provided:

**File:** `add-audit-fields-manual.sql`

This script:
- Adds audit fields to all existing tables
- Creates new user management tables (Role, Permission, UserRole, RolePermission, AuditLog)
- Creates proper indexes for performance
- Handles existing data constraints

## üìã Requirements Compliance

‚úÖ **Requirement 9.4** - User activity audit trail implemented through AuditLog entity and interceptor
‚úÖ **Requirement 9.5** - Comprehensive audit fields on all entities  
‚úÖ **Requirement 1.4** - Clean architecture maintained with proper separation of concerns

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. Apply the database migration (either through EF migrations or manual SQL script)
2. Enhance the AuditInterceptor with proper user context service
3. Test the audit functionality with actual operations
4. Consider adding unique constraints on Email field after data cleanup

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Benefits

- **Comprehensive Auditing**: Every entity change is tracked automatically
- **Soft Delete**: Data is preserved with soft delete functionality
- **User Management**: Complete RBAC system with roles and permissions
- **Performance**: Proper indexes for audit queries
- **Maintainability**: Clean separation of concerns and proper abstractions
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new entities with automatic audit support
